## Planned changes:


3. Move LEDs to bottom (since look from bottom) (rotate switches around)
4. Drill holes in bottom of PBT key caps
5. Shape changes? - thumb cluster etc
6. tenting from top?
7. reposition top 3 keys to reduce AABB size?
8. Keepouts around all screw locations - just switch it to use plated through
   holes

## Changelog v0.2
- Use micro USB instead of TRRS
- Move little holes connecting plates to not be directly next to switch socket
  pads
